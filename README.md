# Compliance Chain(MU)
## 1. Definition
The Compliance Chain functions as a semi-private chain whereby GURUFIN operates the Compliance and Sentry Nodes while the operation and delegation of Watcher Nodes are open to external entities. By employing the Tendermint BFT and Proof-of-Compliance (PoC) consensus algorithms, the network achieves streamlined transaction processing with remarkably low gas fees.

Upon receiving a transaction request, Compliance Nodes assume the responsibility of generating and validating blocks. Blocks are added to the Compliance Chain and monitored by Sentry Nodes for data integrity and potential corruption. Sentry Nodes share information with Watcher Nodes, upholding safeguards against potential threats.

Furthermore, the Compliance Chain provides a conducive environment for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts by integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This integration allows for seamless deployment and execution of smart contracts written in Turingcomplete programming languages, facilitating effortless migration to the Compliance Chain without requiring code modifications.

One notable feature of the Compliance Chain is the issuance of the MU native fiat-backed stable token, which maintains a 1 MU : 1 USD peg and undergoes real-time auditing. The MU token serves as a utility token, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the broader GURUFIN Ecosystem. It provides investors with a stable store of value and enables users to mitigate risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility. In addition to the MU token, the Compliance Chain also supports the issuance of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens.

## 2. Node Types
#### 2-1. Compliance Node 
The Compliance Node is the core entity responsible for operating the network and adhering to Compliance regulations. It performs the role of generating and verifying blocks through the Tendermint BFT and PoC consensus algorithm among Compliance Nodes to process trusted transactions. There are four active Compliance Nodes and one safeguard backup node. 

##### 2-2. Sentry Node 
The Sentry Node acts as a buffer for the Compliance Nodes from external attacks and transmits data to the Watcher Node. It supports the monitoring and verification of the Compliance Chain through synchronized block data. 

#### 2-3. Watcher Node 
The Watcher Node is located on an external network and performs the role of supervising Compliance Node operations. Working in conjunction with the Sentry Node, it oversees block integrity and data corruption generated by Compliance Nodes. GURU is rewarded for participating as a monitor in the Compliance Network. Refer to 3.1 for the Watcher Node Operation Criteria. Qualified and interested applications can email help@GURUFIN.com to initiate the process.
